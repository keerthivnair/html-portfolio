<h1>The Best Movies According to Keerthi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Yeh Jawani yeh Deewani</h3>
<p>
  This is my favourite bollywoodfilm. It shows the deep bonds of friendship,
  love and the whole movie as such is so genuinely feel-good .
</p>
<h3>Devasuram</h3>
<p>
  This is an old classic Lalettan movie( for the malayalis out there who know
  this pillar of mollywood). I love his acting and the nostalgic feel, the
  nuances, and the fierceness of the heroine and the reformed rake arc of the
  hero.

<h3>The Karate Kid 1910</h3>
<p>
  No words other than....Jackie Chan and his witty, kickass young protege. This
  movie was my childhood inspiration. I love it!!
